Question 3: Troubleshooting React App Data Fetching

Background:

You've been provided with a React application designed to retrieve data from the backend of the "SecureLogin" web application project, which you've encountered in question 1. The frontend React app is integrated with the backend using API requests to fetch data.

The React app's primary function is to display data retrieved from the backend. The app architecture involves components, states, and asynchronous data fetching using JavaScript's built-in fetch() function.

Task:

Upon reviewing the React app's code, you've noticed that there's an issue affecting the data fetching process. Candidates are expected to identify the problem, explain the root cause, and propose a solution to resolve it.  

Deliverables:

- A concise description of the identified issue and the root cause.
- A clear and logical explanation of why the issue is occurring.
- A step-by-step resolution plan, including any code changes or adjustments required.

If applicable, candidates can include code snippets to illustrate their proposed solution.  

Note:

Candidates are not required to implement the solution in code. Focus on identifying the problem, diagnosing the root cause, and suggesting a solution.
